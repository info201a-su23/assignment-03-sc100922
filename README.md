## Overview
In many ways, we have come to understand the gravity and trends in the COVID-19 pandemic through data. Regardless of media source, people are consuming more epidemiological information than ever, primarily through reported figures, charts, and maps.

This assignment is your opportunity to work directly with the same data used by the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/). While the analysis is guided through a series of questions, it is your opportunity to use programming skills to ask more detailed questions about the pandemic.

## Getting Started
You should start this assignment by opening up the `analysis.R` script. The script will guide you through an initial analysis of the data.

* **Coding prompts.** Complete the coding prompts in `analysis.R`. You MUST use the `dplyr` package.

* **Reflection prompts.** Throughout `analysis.R`, there are prompts labeled `"Reflection"`. Please write at least 1-3 sentences for each of these prompts below in this `README.md` file. As appropriate, provide evidence, give justification for your opinions, or genuinely reflect on your views. Please strive for concise, clear, and interesting writing.

## Reflection 1
Before actually calculating the total number of COVID cases and deaths, record your guesses for the following questions.

Guess: How many total COVID cases do you think there have been in the U.S.?
I think there are about 100 million cases of COVID-19 in the United States.

Guess: How many total COVID-related deaths do you think there have been in the U.S.?
I think about six million people have died in the United States because of COVID-19.

Guess: Which state do you think has the highest number of COVID cases, and which state do you think has the lowest?
I think New York State has the most COVID-19 cases and Hawaii has the least.

## Reflection 2
Did the number of COVID cases and deaths surprise you? Why or why not? What about the states with the highest and lowest number of cases? How did your guesses line up with the actual results? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences

Iâ€™m surprised by the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths because it's a huge number, and I'm shocked by how much COVID-19 has affected us, especially in California, which has the highest number of cases. American Samoa is fewer Covid cases which also surprised me. For all the Covid-19 cases in the U.S., my guess and the actual results were similar, and I guessed more than I actually did for the death number.

## Reflection 3
Which county has the highest number of cases in the state of Washington, and does it surprise you? Why or why not? (You may need to google this county to learn about it) Answer at least in 1-3 sentences

The county of King has the highest number of COVID-19 cases, approximately 563,019. This is surprising to me as it's far ahead of the second highest, which is a significant number.


## Reflection 4
Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable `lowest_deaths_in_each_state`? That is, wouldn't you expect the number to be around 50? Why is the number greater than 50? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences


## Reflection 5
What do you think about the number and scale of the inconsistencies in the data? Does the fact that there are inconsistencies mean that people should not use this data? Why or why not? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences


## Reflection 6
Why were you interested in this particular question? Were you able to answer your question with code? What did you learn? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences

## Reflection 7
What, if anything, made you curious about this COVID analysis? What, if anything, surprised you? What might you do the same or differently on your next data wrangling project? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
